# FzhHcaCodingExercise

This is a standard iOS application project. Opening the HCACodingExercise.xcodeproj file should be all you need to build the project. I have not done any work to allow you to sign this project. Please feel free to change the bundle identifier and signing authority if you want to build to device.
